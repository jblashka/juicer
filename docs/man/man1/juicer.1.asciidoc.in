NAME
----
juicer - create and push release carts, upload items to pulp



SYNOPSIS
--------
juicer [-vvv] [-V] subcommand [PARAMETERS ...] [OPTIONS ...]



DESCRIPTION
-----------
A release cart is a description of what RPMs you want to push into a
specific repository. A single cart can specify multiple repos and
associated items. Release cart descriptions are saved so you can
easily "promote" a cart to another environment.

RPMs ('items') need not be stored on your local machine. Juicer can
handle remote resources as well. Anywhere an option argument is
described as 'item' you can give the path to a local directory, or
rpm, as well as an RPM available over HTTP. HTTP directory indexes
work as well; the page is parsed and links to rpm files are added to
your cart.

EXAMPLES
--------

'items' given may be any number and combination of the following input
resource types:

*local*::
    ./directory/of/items | ./path/to/item.rpm | /path/to/item*

    The items given are directly uploaded to the pulp server.

Here is an example of how you would specify a directory of *local*
RPMs and a direct path:

    $ juicer upload -r javastuff \
        ~/my-java-app/rpmbuild/noarch/ \
        ~/misc-java-rpms/megafrobber-0.8.0.noarch.rpm


*remote*::

    http[s]://rpms/directory/ | http[s]://website/some-thing.rpm

    URL to an HTTP directory index or an RPM. RPM paths are parsed
    from the index and then added to your cart. All remote items are
    synced when you upload or push.

Here is an example of how you would specify a directory of *remote*
RPMs and a specific remote RPM:

    $ juicer upload -r javastuff \
        http://jenkins.foo/job/results/ \
        http://foo.bar/rpms/megafrobber-0.8.0.noarch.rpm

*create and show a cart*:

    $ juicer create juicer-0.1.7 \
        -r juicer \
        http://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/..../juicer-0.1.7-1.fc17.noarch.rpm \
        -r juicer-deps \
        ./rpm-build/noarch/juicer-misc-0.1.7-1.fc17.noarch.rpm
    Creating cart 'juicer-0.1.7'.
    Saved cart 'juicer-0.1.7'.

    JUICER-DEPS
    -----------
    ./rpm-build/noarch/juicer-misc-0.1.7-1.fc17.noarch.rpm

The cart description is saved into *~/.config/juicer/juicer-carts/* as
*juicer-0.1.7.json*. We could show it again simply:

    $ juicer show juicer-0.1.7
    JUICER
    ------

    ./rpm-build/noarch/juicer-misc-0.1.7-1.fc17.noarch.rpm

Remote items will be synced automatically when we push this cart to
the repositories. Items synced are saved into
*~/.config/juicer/juicer-carts/*'CART-NAME'*-remotes/*.

Similarly, when using the *upload* command, remotes are also synced.
